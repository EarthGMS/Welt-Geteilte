 WBA_flavour.1.t:0 "Fight in the Factory"
 WBA_flavour.1.d:0 "It was a short, ugly little grey building in Munich that everyone besides its workers avoided. It had only two windows, one at the back, and one at the front. Both caked with dust and other filth from years of neglect. Its buildings were similarly dirty, their depressing concrete scarcely interrupted by color. Its dingy conveyor belts, those machines where worker after worker lost their soul to after days and weeks of monotonous work, sat abandoned. The machines which made the products lay still, their workings frozen like a place in time. There were no workers in this factory today, oh no, it lay abandoned, and it had for weeks. For within its walls, Men and women who wanted to revolt against those who managed that very factory sat hunkered around those implementations. Their faces wore expressions of exhaustion, they carried weapons that bore the signs that they had been used many times. Scratches marking kills, chipped wood, and muzle stains all attested to their unyielding fight against Kruppe an his goons. Even now, they could hear it. The factory was surrounded. Kruppe's men were already stalking the area, surrounding the ugly gray building like vultures to carrion.\n\nThe men and women inside knew this. But they were willing to die. They were willing to die for a free, prospering, and Socialist Bavaria, free from Kruppe's corporatism. Free from secret police kidnapping dissidents. Free from capitalist oppression once and for all. These men and women, the followers of Spartakus, the great revolutionary who ran their movement in secret, were going to die that day. They all knew it.\n\nSo when the pounding at the doors began, they knew that the police would come through, and they would die in a gunfight. But they hoped their blood would serve as a rallying cry for their cause, that they would be martyred. And just as they readied their weapons, the doors came crashing down."

 WBA_flavour.2.t:0 "The Battle Continues"
 WBA_flavour.2.d:0 "Kruppe's men made no effort to hide their presence as they made their way into the building. No, their goal was to frighten the revolutionaries as much as possible - an intimidated soldier was not an effective one. However, the revolutionaries would resist as best they could. The first gunfire would come not from Kruppe's men, those class traitors, but from the resistance. Despite the best efforts of the revolutionaries, the attempt was in vain. It was not before long that the revolutionaries were forced to retreat further back in the building. The situation was hopeless, they realized, but any more damage they could do to the enemy was worth the drops of blood.\n\nThe brave men and women of the Liebknecht-Division loaded their guns and, crouched behind any protection they could find - machinery, beneath chairs, near poles - fired. The blow must have been efficient, as in the chaos it appeared that a few enemies had fallen to the ground. However, despite this initial hope, Kruppe's men soon reacted, moving through the frenzy and pushing out as many revolutionaries as they could along the way. In the chaos of the fight at the factory, both sides suffered casualties, sometimes from friendly fire.\n\nResistance in the factory building would continue for many more weeks, and it would not be for months that it could be restored as a proper factory for production purposes, but the most important part was that the morale of the revolutionaries was down. To Kruppe, the best way to squeeze out resistance was to trample upon their souls; without any hope of freedom, freedom would never come."
