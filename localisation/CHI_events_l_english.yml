 CHI_flavour.1.t:0 "The Return from Chita"
 CHI_flavour.1.d:0 "The epitome of all the evils of the past society.\n\nPuyi was a man whose every step was hated by the Chinese people, a man who had betrayed his nation time and time again. He embodied everything the revolution had sought to destroy. And now, it was the right time for justice to be brought for all those whom he had brought constant pain and suffering to for all these years.\n\nNow, he was returning to Harbin Majiagou Airport to face trial in China. The trial itself was largely symbolic, seeing as Chiang Kai-shek had already expressed that revolutionary justice would be brought down against the failed emperor, in the form of execution. Thus, the government had made it an event to instill a sense of patriotism and revolutionary values amongst the Chinese people, by inviting former slaves of the collaborationist regime in Manchuria, resistance fighters who had risked their lives to fight against the Japanese occupiers, and veterans of the War of Resistance, many of which had lost a leg or an arm during the war.\n\nPuyi stepped out of his plane. Despite his show, it was obvious to all observers that he was nervous. He trembled as he stepped on to the airfield, hardly noticing the great temperature difference with the cold weather in Chita. He was home now, but at what cost? There were a good number of Chinese citizens who wanted him executed within the next week.\n\nAnd for good reason, he realized. He had wronged the people of China. It was too late for him to change that. He knew he had to accept his fate. Ultimately, justice came first. During his many mistakes and faults throughout his life, he had come to understand that truth. He forced himself not to avoid the gaze of the many people watching.\n\n“China, I have come to accept my fate.”"

 CHI_flavour.2.t:0 "The Last Communist"
 CHI_flavour.2.d:0 "He had spent more than half an hour flipping through the different maps of the National Assembly, looking for anyone who might support his budget motion, to no avail. The reality had dawned on Deng Xiaoping long ago: he was the last communist with any relevance in Chinese political affairs, with most of them having been killed in the great post-civil war purges. In the end, it was shocking that Chiang Kai-shek and his dogs had never gotten around to killing him. But here he was, a member of the senior legislative body in the Republic of China.\n\nDeng had great dreams for what he could make from China, itself a skeleton for greater goals. But the realization of these dreams seemed unlikely so long as the National Assembly was still dominated by politicians of the mainstream Kuomintang. Deng figured that he had been spared due to his vision. He was a communist, yes, but a pragmatic one: he acknowledged that China was by no means prepared for socialism. That was the great mistake of the old communists of Jiangxi.\n\nThere was also a little bit of opportunism as well. Ultimately, Deng Xiaoping aspired for power. Whatever form that power might come in, whichever policies he might have to enact to get the favor of the various bureaucrats and officials that held the keys of power in China, Deng Xiaoping desired it. He was sick and tired of attending meetings of the National Assembly only to see these politicians with their incorrect form of governance. Even when it came down to the smallest things, they made the worst decisions. He wondered if politicians knew that emotion doesn’t belong in the political scene.\n\nDeng Xiaoping closed his folder unexpectedly. He stood up and grabbed a pen as well as a sheet of paper. He scribbled a few notes, marked a few maps, studied a few old documents from the dusty, unused section of his desk. Then, he marvelled at his work, and for the first time since 1945, he smiled."

 CHI_flavour.3.t:0 "The Reformer"
 CHI_flavour.3.d:0 "Zhang Qun was concentrated on his work, focused as always. He was writing another land reform bill, as the last four he had proposed were ultimately never voted on due to disagreements about a proposed revision which led to a boycott of the session by the military faction. This one, he knew, would be just radical enough to be immense progress for China, and just pragmatic enough to please the various factions of Chinese politics which resisted the reforms that he knew inevitably ought to be implemented in China due to the end of the civil war.\n\nAll that he would need to entice the businesses was a little reward, just some subsidies to help them “deal with new weather conditions” and “adapt to modern technological advancements”. Given the context of the ongoing new agricultural revolution in the United States and elsewhere, the excuse was all too perfect. He liked to consider himself the outsider on the inside, working for the reformist cause by convincing those barriers to change to come over to his side. It was the best that could be done, after all; everyone else who had gone about doing this by other means had failed.\n\nSure, it was a lot of work to balance the influence of all the factions and make sure they will all be pleased, but it was worth it for China. After all, why does one become a politician in the first place? Because they must be dedicated to improving the lives of the people they worked for. Zhang Qun did not have such foolish dreams as that he was ‘destined’ to reform China. Rather, he was a man who wanted to reform China."

 CHI_flavour.4.t:0 "The Confucianist"
 CHI_flavour.4.d:0 "It was good to be back in Qingzhi Mountain. Last time Lin Sen had been here, it was 1926. Boy had some things happened since then. The war, the chaos, the war of Chinese men against Chinese men, and now Lin Sen found himself leader of an entire political movement: the Conservative movement. Balancing calls for liberalisation from the reformist bloc with the pragmatic, slightly authoritarian policies of the mainstream Kuomintang, Lin Sen’s conservative movement supported a return to traditional Confucian values and the democratisation of China.\n\nLin Sen was an old man, and the great peace he felt as Qingzhi was sorely needed. Despite his advanced age, Lin Sen still participated in politics because it was his great passion to serve the Chinese people and right the wrongs he saw in the present society. Of course, in order to find these wrongs in the first place, he had to understand the life of the average Chinese person. And so he did.\n\nAnother tour in another city, another meeting with teachers, another day spent fishing with locals, it was what Lin Sen thought politics was for. He was determined to look at China and find what was wrong with it. And then he could find what was needed."

 CHI_flavour.5.t:0 "The Pragmatist"
 CHI_flavour.5.d:0 "They say that shaking hands is the best way to gain allies in the political landscape. This is especially true in Chinese politics, infamous for its constant backstabbing and political gridlock. So naturally, that is what a pragmatic man such as Chen Lifu would be doing on any good Tuesday evening, meeting with no-name officials as a means by which to reduce the effectiveness of another proposed reformist bill.\n\nChen’s pragmatic approach to politics made him loved and hated in the National Assembly. Apart from Chiang Kai-shek himself, Chen was considered the greatest obstacle in the way of the reformist proposals’ realization. In Chen’s view, these were proposals that would rip apart the very seams which the fragile Chinese democracy was built on. More than anything else, China needed order and stability in these times. He sensed good things coming soon for China, as the nation became increasingly geopolitically important in the cold war developing between the United States and Soviet Union. Perhaps China could use its leverage to get a beneficial deal…\n\nWhether he is loved or hated, few doubt that Chen is one of the most powerful people in Chinese politics. Forming a large pragmatic clique in the National Assembly with his brother Chen Guofu, he had made his way up the ranks through a mix of charisma and more than questionable decisions. The alliance he had made with his brother secured his political position, and it was one that Chen was confident would be maintained for a very, very long time."

 CHI_flavour.6.t:0 "The Officer"
 CHI_flavour.6.d:0 "Li Jishen had finally returned home after a long day of training new recruits at the Whampoa Military Academy. It had been a productive day, but that made it no less tiring. But, before he went to sleep, he had to deal with a few letters he had received that day. Most of them, as usual, were useless, but one stood out to him. It had an official government seal, and undoubtedly was important. Holding the envelope in his hand, he took out from it a long paper with the national emblem on the top.\n\nAs it turned out, it was a letter requesting his return to the National Assembly. At first, Li shook his head. It was a recipe for disaster. Last time he had served in the National Assembly he had clashed far too much with Chiang Kai-shek, and he preferred his military role anyways. But from the letter itself, they didn’t seem to be asking. He sighed."

 CHI_flavour.7.t:0 "Worrying Signs from the Provinces"
 CHI_flavour.7.d:0 "The nation of China is an agricultural one. From the southern provinces of Guangxi to Beijing, Chinese are still largely agricultural workers. They might own their land and hire laborers to farm it for them, or they might simply farm it themselves, with the help of some laborers that they hire. On the lower rungs of society, however, there are people who hire no laborers, who merely own their own land, and farm it themselves. Lastly, there are the Laborers themselves, who might own their own little scrap of land, but mostly work for the middle class farmers. During the Civil War, Red bandits would go through villages and murder the upper class farmers and Landlords, creating terror wherever they went. When the Reds took Dongbei, and most of China's industry with it, China's economy relied almost entirely on the agricultural sectors of China's devastated economy.\n\nThe Minister, Zhang Qun knew these facts. He knew as well that any decrease was a horrible sign for China's economy. One that had still not recovered from wartime inflation and economic devastation. So when Qun entered his office, a windowless room in a smoky warehouse in Nanjing, he knew that the vanilla file on his desk, delivered by a mailman that morning could be a bad sign. And he was partially right. Upon steadying his reading glasses, his sweaty forehead leaving some of his graying black hair wet and stuck, he opened the file, his brown eyes darting over, his pupils getting smaller and smaller. The news was bad. Agricultural output had declined from this year from last. The news wasn't all bad, of course. Industry rose, and population had rose up since last year, but the news from the farming sector could ruin those. The minister sat back. He did not want to be the one who told the President about that."
