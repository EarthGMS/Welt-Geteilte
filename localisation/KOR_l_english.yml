 KOR_flavour.1.t:0 "An Island of Odeng"
 KOR_flavour.1.d:0 "Hojin hated that he dreamt every time he fell asleep, for every dream was the same. His mother calls him inside to eat dinner. The tables would be ready but everyone had to wait for the grandfather to start eating. His mother made jeyuk again, but the red paste of the pork was losing its color with every new day. Hojin recollected that it was somewhere around the nine-hundredth dinner that his father had missed. It was that moment, as Hojin was gathering some pork onto his plate that he expressed his wish to follow his father into the war. His grandfather would spit out the jeyuk and loudly berate him for that, every single time, and that’s where the dream would end.\n\nHojin wished he could at least eat in his dreams, for it would be a change from his surroundings. But all he would have were the sweet smell of jeyuk bokkeum slowly replaced by that of burning coal as he rose into consciousness. Hojin’s mouth was almost out of saliva to moisten itself, and the heat from the stove exacerbated it. As usual, they’d have odeng for lunch, and its broth for the drink. It was the only food left on the island. Dal-sam promised they would leave Jeju soon enough, but every time he assured them, there seemed to be less faith in his voice.\n\nThe dreams made his tribulations even worse, for it seemed that a reactionary god mocked his cause for every night that passed. But for Hojin, it did not matter if any god was against them. It was too late to betray the cause. It was too late to escape the island. It was too late to see his family ever again. And the belief that it was all too late to change his destiny was the only thing keeping him going."
