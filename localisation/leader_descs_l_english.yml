 POLITICS_MARKOS_VAFEIADIS_DESC:0 "Having spent his early life in the Ottoman town of Tosya in what is now the Republic of Turkey, the mass exchange of population based on the borders of Greece and Turkey would dislocate Markos's family as refugees into their so-called new motherland. Markos would come already disillusioned with the prospect of nationalist glory, finding refuge and solace within the circle of the Young Communist League of Greece that he would join in 1928.\n\nHis conviction of anti-nationalism would further be cemented by the failures of the Metaxist regime that found itself invaded by the fascist coalition of the Axis powers that they once idolized. Finding himself as a natural guerilla fighter and resistance leader in the fight against the German occupiers, Vafeiadis rose through the ranks of the Communist Party of Greece as a man whose skills in leadership were as sharp as his looks.\n\nThe vacuum of authority left by the end of Axis occupation would eventually come to be filled by two aspiring regimes of the communists and the monarchists, a rivalry which would spring forth into a full-blown civil war. As the most instrumental leader in the Communist victory, Vafeiadis would soon be elected as the first leader of the newborn Democratic Republic of Greece.\n\nOnce an idolizer of the Bolsheviks, Vafeiadis found himself frustrated with the increasingly overbearing Moscow leadership, choosing to shift his allegiance to the more grassroots-focused communists of Yugoslavia. As the co-founder of the European Socialist Community along with Josip Broz Tito, Greece now stands with Yugoslavia as the pole of a new movement, one that offers an alternative to the Soviet model for building socialism."

 POLITICS_JOSIP_BROZ_TITO_DESC:0 "Born to Croat and Slovene parents in the old Austro-Hungarian Empire, Josip Broz Tito dedicated much of his adult life to the Socialist cause, joining the Communist Party of Yugoslavia in 1920 and in 1925 after losing his job at a mill he became a professional revolutionary. From then on he was under constant investigation, regularly being arrested or having to flee the authorities. For a time he left his homeland, travelling Europe and assisting Communist Parties across the continent.\n\nAfter the death of the previous leader of the CPY, Milan Gorkić, Tito returned to take the reins of the party, bringing young voices into the upper echelons of the party. When the Germans began their occupation of Yugoslavia, Tito led his partisans in a constant resistance of the foreign invaders and those who collaborated with them, it was this resistance that gained them the respect of the local population as well as support from the Western Allies.\n\nOnce the war was over, popular support within the newly freed Yugoslavia allowed Tito’s communists to quickly consolidate power, establishing a Socialist state. However, unlike many of the other Eastern European nations that underwent similar liberations, the Red Army had not been majorly involved in the Yugoslav liberation and so Soviet influence on Tito’s government remained marginal. As the Bolsheviks increased their efforts to bring Yugoslavia in line with their model of Socialism, Tito rejected their influence, instead forming the European Socialist Community with the similarly frustrated Greek leader, Markos Vafeiadis. Now, only time will tell whether this alliance can survive the pressure it faces from the Soviets in the East and De Gaulle’s ‘Free Europe’ in the West."

 POLITICS_ANTONIO_SALAZAR_DESC:0 "Antonio Salazar's efforts towards accession as leader of Estado Novo seemed more driven by pragmatic civic duty than some sense of a mystical national mission. His ambitions were only with keeping Portugal's economy stable, keeping her out of continental wars, and keeping left-wing radicals away from her. While successful, Portugal under Salazar remained a solitary fortress that seldom reached out to her oldest ally in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe rise of Free Europe following the Second World War would convince Salazar to let Portugal out of her isolation onto a community of like-minded nationalists that had the interests of European prosperity at heart. As sad as he was to see that the British weren't following France's lead, it was Salazar with a heavy heart who made the decision to leave Britain behind for the prospect of European unity.\n\nWho would eventually be waiting for Salazar down the line was an almost-giddy Francisco Franco with the proposition of a unified Iberian Peninsula, for the sake of strength and prosperity for both Portugal and Spain. The other major Free Europe partners of De Gaulle and Mussolini had both backed the proposal, and Salazar would secretly curse all three of their names as despots who subjugated Europe under the name of freeing it. The bridge with Britain was already burned, and with no other place to turn to, Salazar acceded.\n\nSalazar's luck would turn however, as Francisco Franco was shot dead by an aspirant insurrectionary, right in the midst of the unification talks. Spain would tumble into chaos with the absence of their dear leader, and that would provide Salazar with the opportunity to secure greater power. Spain would rush to appoint the hapless Carlos Arias Navarro as their new Caudillo, a man that Salazar would eventually outmaneuver, cementing the influence of Estado Novo far more than originally presumed.\n\nOnce the dust had settled and the talks were over, Iberia was one, Portugal and Spain were equal entities under a single state, and Navarro and Salazar were its twin leaders. But the truth remained that the power Salazar secured had essentially made him de facto Comandante of all Iberia. Say that in Madrid and one gets arrested, but say that in Lisbon and one only receives smiles. For it seems that Portugal may look like a junior partner to Spain on a map, but it was Navarro who was a junior partner to Salazar in the government."

 POLITICS_BENITO_MUSSOLINI_DESC:0 "Benito Mussolini is one of the most influential people in the world. He started his career off as the editor in chief of a socialist newspaper, before being cast out due to supporting the First World War. After being alienated from Socialist circles, he founded Fascism, one of the biggest ideologies in the 1920s and 30s. His ideas would eventually catch on, and it resulted in the March on Rome, an organized demonstration that resulted in him becoming Il Duce.\n\nEventually, the Second World War started. Adolf Hitler, another fascist leader, sought Mussolini’s help during it. After much thought, Mussolini would refuse to enter World War Two fully, but agreed to helping Hitler invade and split Yugoslavia. The Italian Invasion of Yugoslavia officially started soon after.\n\nYugoslavia proved to be a much harder challenge than previously thought, however. The partisans, with help from the Red Army, pushed back the Italian Army. Defeat after defeat culminated in a full retreat from Yugoslavia. The Italian Army returned home broken and embarrassed.\n\nMussolini would keep his power over Italy until today. Now, however, Il Duce is not the man he used to be. The years have made him old and weak, ready to die at any moment. Many expect that if Il Duce does not appoint a successor his life's work will fall apart.""
