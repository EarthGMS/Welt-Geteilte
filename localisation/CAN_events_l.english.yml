 CAN_flavour.1.t:0 "Keeping the Oil Flowing"
 CAN_flavour.1.d:0 "Oil, oil, oil. Oil is a most precious resource, essential to any industrialized nation to keep its economy on the move. Canada is one of those lucky nations which happens to have the advantage of the ability to produce oil itself. Canada is home to massive oil reserves, and the oil will keep flowing as long as it remains a valuable resource.\n\nHowever, the question of how to most efficiently extract this oil is always present in Canadian economic discussion. The majority of these reserves are located in the oil sands of Alberta, and are owned and operated by the state. The close cooperation between the Canadian government and private businesses to maximize oil extraction has been greatly successful, but more changes will need to be made to make the industry more profitable as oil quickly becomes the backbone of the Canadian economy.\n\nSt. Laurent's government has seen more positive developments, with the construction of the Interprovincial Pipeline System in 1950 after the discovery of oil deposits near Leduc in 1947. Proposals for expansion to supply the Ontario market as well as a new Trans-Mountain Pipeline System are under the consideration of the Canadian government."
