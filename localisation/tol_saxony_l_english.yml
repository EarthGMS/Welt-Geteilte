 POLITICS_SAX_WILHELM_PIECK_DESC:0 "Wilhelm Pieck is the definition of a German Communist. Born in 1876, he was an early member of the Communist Party of Germany. With the KPD, he escaped death while Rosa Luxembourg and Karl Liebknecht were being murdered. Afterwards, he became of the founders of the International Red Aid, and the chairman of the Rote Hilfe.\n\nOnce the Nazis rose to power, Pieck fled Germany to the Soviet Union. He lived in exile until the end of the war. Once the Nazis laid defeated, he returned to Germany for good. He settled in the newly founded North German Confederation and rose to become the leader of the Communist Party there. After the North German Confederation fell apart, Pieck was able to exert enough influence over Saxony to set up a communist statelet there.\n\nNow, Pieck is starting to get old. He’s done all he can to set up Saxony, now whoever his successor will be must do their best to keep it. Whoever that may be."
