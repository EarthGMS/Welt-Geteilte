 albania_flavour.1.d:0 "“But father, I want to help my nation!”\n\nThis was the appeal which Shafaq Kabashi’s son had made to him on a day he would never be given the opportunity to forget. Shafaq was an agent for the Sigurimi, and he was used to “dealing with” people with anti-communist sympathies. But this, of course, was different. It was his own son. What could he do?\n\nHe understood what his son wanted. He wanted freedom from the very things that Shafaq had spent his career doing, the surveillance and control over the people of Albania like dangling hands diligently managing the strings of the nation. His son was what would be designated by the Sigurimi as a counterrevolutionary.\n\nIt was there he realized that fighting against Hoxha and his dogs (which, it occurred to him, included him) was a noble cause. His son wanted to leave to join the Free Albania National Committee in Paris, an organization dedicated to ending Hoxha’s regime of terror. Noble as it was, it was also dangerous. There was hardly any chance of his son managing to get past the border guards, and even if he did, how would he possibly survive if the operation to “free Albania” did occur? Perhaps the Committee wouldn’t even accept him; he was sixteen, after all.\n\nBut then again…\n\nIt was not his decision. He could no longer control his son, and ultimately he ought to follow his heart, wherever that might take him. Would he spend the next few weeks, months, no, years worrying about him and regretting the decision that he made? He knew he would. But it was the right thing to do.\n\n“Very well. Please, stay safe.”"
