 FRA_flavour.1.t:0 "Layers of Bureaucracy"
 FRA_flavour.1.d:0 "There is a common myth that a bureaucracy develops over time - that all of these layers of administrative nothingness take years to fully insert themselves into a system. This myth has absolutely been proven wrong by the example of France, which has developed itself a massive bureaucracy within the course of only a few years since the defeat of Germany and the nation's liberation by Charles de Gaulle and Free France.\n\nTo Francois Mitterand, navigating this byzantine system was a fact of life since the war. Once, he was one of the glorious resistance fighters that resisted the German occupation. However, this would soon change as Henri Giraud, was sidelined, and Mitterand found what he had seen as brave comrades in the resistance met with indifference in post-war France. Despite his shaky past, De Gaulle viewed him favorably, and although hardly anyone in France knew his name, he was a man to be reckoned with in French politics.\n\nMitterand smiled as he headed to work. It was a Monday morning, and the entire nation of France appeared to be waking up from the weekend. The streets were busy as people rushed to work, but for Mitterand today was especially important. He would be submitting his economic proposals to De Gaulle. Despite his more radical outlook on how the French economy should be structured, Mitterand was cautious to toe the line as not to be viewed as too suspicious in the party's eyes."
