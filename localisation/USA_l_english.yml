 USA_jim_crow_laws_desc:0 "So-called “Jim Crow Laws” were implemented in the Southern United States towards the end of the last century and into the beginning of the 1900s. These laws protect racial segregation in the United States, and while attempts have been made to begin fighting against these policies, they still continue to this day. Criticized by the growing Civil Rights movement as backwards and contrary to America’s primary principle of liberty, these laws have been described as a relic of the past. Since the abolition of slavery, rights have been expanded for coloured Americans, but many consider these segregationist laws to merely be a watered-down form of slavery. Ultimately, it seems that these policies are in decline, with President Truman having issued an executive order to desegregate the military in 1948. This has led to resistance from the opponents of reform, and racial tensions have greatly heightened within our country in the last few years. The path is still open for the future."

 USA_cia_protection:0 "CIA Protection"
 USA_cia_protection_desc:0 "Established in 1947, the Central Intelligence Agency has protected us from foreign threats to our nation since its foundation. The organization was created to fight against communism, which is the single greatest threat to world peace today. Americans can sleep comfortable at night knowing that the communist threat will not get to us so long as we are protected by the CIA. Given the power of the institution, some have criticized it as having overextended its power, destroying liberty in the name of protecting it. Of course, these claims are baseless. The CIA has preserved and even allows us to spread liberty."

 USA_the_green_revolution_desc:0 "Since the beginning of the decade, agricultural production in the United States has been booming as a result of new technology transfer initiatives. Dubbed the “Green Revolution”, this new agricultural revolution has led to reduced rates of starvation in our country, allowing for an increase in population and a more prosperous nation. Pioneered by the agronomist Norman Borlaug, the Green Revolution is a significant development for the American nation, and no doubt one which proves the efficiency and effectiveness of the free market system. In fact, foreign investments have led to increased social stability in developing nations, reducing the chance for communists who will align with the Soviets to take power. Overall, the new Green Revolution has positive effects for our nation!"

 USA_golden_age_of_capitalism:0 "The Golden Age of Capitalism"
 USA_golden_age_of_capitalism_desc:0 "After the end of World War II, the American economy boomed. Productivity growth, the implementation of Keynesian economic policies, boosts to military spending, and other factors have led to a great increase in economic prosperity in the United States and the rest of the free world. This “Golden Age of Capitalism” has led to increased faith in the idealized American dream, and many Americans have been lifted into the middle class. For the first time in a very long time, a positive economic trend can be seen in the American economy. Whether this trend will continue is yet to be seen, but many are hopeful as we enter the second half of this century."

 USA_leader_of_the_free_world:0 "Leader of the Free World"
 USA_leader_of_the_free_world_desc:0 "Since the end of the Second World War, the United States and the Soviet Union have slowly drifted apart, tragically proving that the alliance between the two nations during the war was not to last. As an iron curtain rapidly descends, America has proven itself to be the true leader of the free world. Projects such as the Marshall Plan, Mutual Security Act, National Committee for a Free Europe, NATO, and the Warsaw Airlift have proven America’s dedication to spreading freedom and democracy throughout the world. Sometimes, of course, we must do things that are less than pretty, but it is all necessary in order to achieve the dream of liberty, freedom, prosperity, and democracy across the globe. Its critics call it “American hegemony”, but in reality, it is the path to world peace!"

 USA_the_great_red_scare:0 "The Great Red Scare"
 USA_the_great_red_scare_desc:0 "In the beginning of this century, mainly due to the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia, a wave of fear swept the nation over the threat of communism. While it ended after some time, this wave of fear has returned again as a “cold war” has broken out with our rival superpower, the Soviet Union. In the new red scare, suspected communists have been investigated by the government, primarily the House Un-American Activities Committee. The Great Red Scare has been championed by Joseph McCarthy, who infamously accused a number of employees in the U.S. State Department of being active spies and members of the Communist Party USA. Widespread fears of communist subversion and infiltration of American institutions and industries is at its peak, and it seems unlikely that this will change any time soon."

 POLITICS_HARRY_TRUMAN_DESC:0 "After the death of former President Franklin Roosevelt on April 12th, 1945, Truman had big shoes to fill, and, as we approach the end of his second term, many of his supporters agree that he has filled them. The United States is considered to be a global superpower, and the United States now has influence in every part of the world, from Western Europe to the Middle East, and all the way in east Asia, challenged only by the USSR. After its victory against the Japanese, China fell into a bloody civil war with the Chiang Kai-Shek-led Kuomintang defeating the Communists led by Mao Zedong, with help from the US. But with the splitting of Korea and Japan into northern Soviet-aligned states and southern American-aligned states, a brand new second Red Scare, and with the Soviet Union establishing itself a sphere in Europe, there is opposition to President Truman by the Republican Party regarding his foreign policy, domestic policy, and his new "Fair Deal" that aims to continue the tradition of Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal policies while building Truman's own legacy. But one question must be asked by the American people, both supporters and opponents of Truman. How long will this newfound prosperity last, and will it be extended under a third term or will one of his opponents win out?"
