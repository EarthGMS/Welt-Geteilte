 cursed.1.d:0 "Their faces were obscured in the dark, but to Marshal Rokossovsky it was not too hard to make out who they were. They were his fallen comrades. Immortal victims of a cause that had never come to fruition; of course, to the frustration of Rokossovsky. Since they had disappeared Rokossovsky had spent years attempting to put together the remnants of the plan that had been assembled into a cohesive idea, but to no avail.\n\nAnd now they were back?\n\nRokossovsky took to dismissing it immediately. He was used to the NKVD trying to find anything to use against him, and this was of course an appeal to emotion. It represented an alarming one, however. Beria and his dogs had caught on to Rokossovsky’s past history. It was only a matter of hours before the thug reported him to the Polish government. Since he had taken his post, he had attempted to realize the dream in Poland itself. But that had quite evidently failed. But he would not allow Beria to win. If he would die inevitably, he wouldn’t allow Beria to be the one to do it.\n\nThe next morning, Rokossovsky was no more. The great plan for Russia was over."
