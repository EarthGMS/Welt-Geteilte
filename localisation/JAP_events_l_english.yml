 JAP_flavour.1.t:0 "Mosaburō Speaks?"
 JAP_flavour.1.d:0 "“Hello, is this Mosaburō Suzuki?”\n\nMosaburō picked up the phone, half expecting that he was being called to court to deal with yet another claim against him. The other half of him expected it would be announcing that the government had shut down his newspaper for the third time this month. “Yes, I’m here.”\n\n“Sorry about calling so late - I’ve been busy dealing with legal claims. But hey, is there any way you could make it to the conference in Chiyoda this weekend? They’re inviting you to speak.”\n\n“Er - yeah, sure. I’m honestly surprised it’s you, Kanjū. There’s been so many claims against us recently that I’ve stopped being worried about them and now I just hope they can grow the strength to imprison me already.” He chuckled, and so did his friend from across the line.\n\n“I am running short on time though, so we can speak later.” Kanjū hung up after some pleasantries had been exchanged and Mosaburō copied the details of the event. He sat back down in his office chair, humming for a few moments before taking out a pen, a paper, and getting to work on his speech."

 JAP_flavour.2.t:0 "The 1951 Economic Report"
 JAP_flavour.2.d:0 "Mamoru Shigemitsu loved his office. In his mind, it was the greatest working environment imagineable - complete with a lovely bookshelf on the wall behind his desk and adorned with a large Japanese flag next to his window, which provided a great view of Tokyo. From the comfortable black chair to the flowers on the side of his desk to the lamp on his left side, Shigemitsu found comfort in every aspect of his office. Most importantly, it reminded him of the service he owed to the nation he loved: Japan.\n\nAlthough Shigemitsu enjoyed his work, he could not deny that it was sometimes tiring. This was true especially when it came to managing matters of the economy, a cumbersome task. Today, on his desk, lay the 1951 Economic Report, detailing the economic situation of South Japan this past year. He straightened his papers and quickly began reading.\n\nThe first matter discussed in the report was the raw data. The chapter contained a neat chart with the total production output, business investment, industrial production, agricultural production, and purchasing power. This data contained worrying signs: despite an increase in purchasing power, production overall and in specific categories had declined slightly. Fears of economic stagnation already plagued the South Japanese government. Now, however, the failure of Shigemitsu's government to recover the South Japanese economy to pre-war levels could be a disaster for him politically. Although the next section contained "Legislative recommendations for moving forward" and "Likely causes of economic stagnation", Shigemitsu could not be bothered to read any further."
