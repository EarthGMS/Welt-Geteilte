 ITA_flavour.1.t:0 "The White-Robed Man"
 ITA_flavour.1.d:0 "The Desert looked endless. Its windy emptiness was alien to the passengers. They were men, women, and children of Italy, people who came to Ethiopia were a varied group. Adventurous explorers, religious missionaries, and exiles who disliked Mussoloni’s Fascist state. They looked out the windows of the bus, its grey interior sparse without anything to give distraction to the desert space that they drove past. The driver was also bored. His eyes barely paying attention to the road ahead. As such, he barely noticed the man standing in the road. A man who was entirely covered in white robes. The driver would notice him, almost too late, and stopped five feet from the man. The man, or that's what the driver thought it was, the robes obscured it, was unfazed. The passengers, now in the stopped bus, started heading to the front, their annoyance audible in their grumbling.\n\n The man disappeared from the front just as the driver was confronted by the passengers, their anger rising by the second. The heat bearing down on the bus, making it feel like an oven. The man was nowhere to be seen. The driver began suspecting that he had seen a mirage, before a light tapping was heard at the passenger door. Everyone stopped their mutterings and griping. At the door was the man in the robes. His face was still obscured. He appeared to be holding something. Some looked at him, and then jumped back, all having seen the same thing. He was holding a weapon, an automatic rifle. The man then spoke. “Open the door and leave your vehicle. His voice confirmed that he was indeed a man, one with a deep, booming voice, and speaking perfect Italian. The driver had a pistol, but not knowing if there were more insurgents, he decided against using it.\n The passengers, crying in fear, whining, or silent got off the bus “There are more of my comrades around here. Do not try anything.” the insurgent said. They all believed him. He entered the bus, and left with food and supplies, and the bus driver's pistol. “Get back in the bus, but do not go to your original destination, there is nothing there for you”. They all went back on, and the driver turned around, heading back to the Italian base. Every passenger contemplated the man in the robes who had just taken some things from their bus, as he stood on the road, watching them, until he disappeared into the sands."
