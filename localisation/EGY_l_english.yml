 POLITICS_FAROUK_I_DESC:0 "Farouk I of Egypt lies on an unstable mess of a country. Born in 1920 to King Faud, he was raised for rule at an early age. Like most of the Egyptian elite, he never cared for the Egyptian culture, rather he preferred his Albanian heritage. As a child, he forced servants to get on their knees and kiss his hands. King Faud wanted to send Farouk to Italy for his education, however the British High Commissioner forced Faud to send him to the Royal Military Academy in the United Kingdom.\n\nAt the Royal Military Academy, Farouk was a horrible student. Due to his spoiled upbringing, he expected that exam answers would be handed to him during the exams, and never bothered to study due to it. In 1936, his father would die, and he would ascend to the throne at the young age of 16. His first act as King was to accept condolences from King Edward VII of the United Kingdom.\n\nThe political scene in Egypt had changed with Farouk’s ascension. He was an extremely popular King, which led the dominant Wafd party to feel threatened by him. The King then started to align with other parties, especially the Muslim Brotherhood. The Wafd Party would then attack the king with accusations of violating the constitution by being too publicly religious. This backfired on the Wafd and they were accused of attacking the Muslim majority.\n\nKing Farouk would then meet with the German Propaganda Minister, Joseph Goebbels, which lead to the British High Commissioner to see him as a Nazi Sympathizer. Egypt, however, remained neutral during World War Two. After the War, Farouk would commonly be known as a pro-Italian, fascist sympathizer.\n\nNow, the once popular King is despised by his people. Instability grows as people become more and more radicalized. The once monarchist Right Wing has been united under the Muslim Brotherhood against Farouk, and the Left has been split into the Arab Socialist Union and the Egyptian Communist Party. Farouk’s days on the throne are numbered as Egypt bursts into flames around him."
