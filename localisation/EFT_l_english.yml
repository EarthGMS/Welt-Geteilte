 POLITICS_ALBERT_KESSELRING_DESC:0 "A veteran of both World Wars and one of the most decorated commanders in the Luftwaffe, Kesselring sacrificed much for his country, even as the Reich and its Führer fell, he saw hope in the ashes. Joining up with Speer's remnant in Thuringia, he began to consider how to make the next Reich, his Reich succeed. Both the Kaiser and the Führer had failed Germany and so Kesselring concluded that no single ideology could save Germany, instead opting for a fusion of the successes of the past.\n\nNow, Speer lies dead, and the fragile coalition of the remaining Nazis has shattered. In this chaos, Kesselring saw his opportunity, took those loyal to him to the city of Erfurt and began to plan Germany's reunification. As a sort of middle ground between the pragmatic Speidel and the hardline Schnez, Kesselring has found support amongst the remaining Luftwaffe pilots as well as more moderate German Nationalists and those with Monarchist sympathies."
