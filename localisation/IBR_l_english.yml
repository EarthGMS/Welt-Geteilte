 IBR_shadow_of_franco:0 "Shadow of Franco"
 IBR_shadow_of_franco_desc:0 "Iberia is a great nation that brought two nations together in glorious unification. However, the road to Unification was a bumpy ride. During the Unification talks, Francisco Franco, the leader of Spain, was shot to death. This would give an opportunity to Antonio Salazar to take great control over the entirety of the new nation of Iberia.\n\nAll is not well in Iberia, however. Salazar underestimated how great the support of Franco was, and they will give him trouble for all his reign. Throughout the government of Iberia, supporters of Franco’s legacy oppose Salazar and his de facto control over Iberia."

 IBR_estado_novo:0 "Estado Novo"
 IBR_estado_novo_desc:0 "Unification under outsized Salazarist influence has made the ideology of the Portuguese Estado Novo encompass all aspects of Iberian life. Its governance under a technocratic dictatorship, rhetoric of conservative nationalism, dominance of Catholicism and the economic model of dirigiste corporatism has transformed Iberia into a highly traditionalist state in its culture, society and class.\n\nIberia had traded stability for progress, and its society presents like it has been stuck in a singular point in time, alien in nature and aesthetic to any modern man. A fortress of eternal nostalgia."

 IBR_separatist_terrorism:0 "Separatist Terrorism"
 IBR_separatist_terrorism_desc:0 "For decades there have been separatists in the Spanish part of Iberia. This is a clear-cut fact thanks to the Catalonian Anarchists and Basque separatists of the Spanish Civil War. And with the unification of Iberia, we must now face the threat of the Separatists that have been inherited from Franco's regime. But these separatists seem to have taken notice of our government originating in Portugal and have since been more active in their regions, for they believe we will put Portugal in a higher position than Spain, let alone their provinces.\n\nBut now Iberia faces two paths, put down the separatists by force thereby lowering our stability even more, or giving in to the demands of the terrorists but losing our grasp of our country perhaps inspiring more separatists. Or perhaps a compromise, the fate of these regions will soon be shown as Iberia can't take much more pressure from these traitors."

 IBR_church_domination:0 "Church Domination"
 IBR_church_domination_desc:0 "The Roman Catholic Church remains the most prevalent religion within Iberia, with nearly every aspect of life dominated by the teachings of the Vatican. Salazar's national conservative state has formed an unwritten coalition with the Iberian clergy, reinforcing each other's legitimacy and mutually enabling each other's dominance within the Iberian Peninsula.\n\nHaving been made the official state religion by the government, the Catholic Church has been one of the most significant ideological tools of Salazar's regime, serving as a sinew that binds the people of Spain and Portugal together."

 IBR_internal_disagreements:0 "Internal Disagreements"
 IBR_internal_disagreements_desc:0 "Given the large amount of pressure placed upon the governments of Spain and Portugal to push for a unification deal after the death of Francisco Franco, many of the basic functions of the new Iberian state remain unclear. Many questions plague the newborn federation and those who once idealized the idea of Iberian unification now find the practicality of their ideas put to the test.\n\nAs Portuguese and Spanish political leaders continue to squabble over issues such as taxation and policing, the Federation's leaders, Antonio Salazar of Portugal and Carlos Arias Navarro of Spain, continue their endless chess game. The board is the Iberian nation, and the reward is the fate of the entire peninsula."
