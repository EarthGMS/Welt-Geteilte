 SOV_focus.1.t:0 "Bringing Up The Succession Question"
 SOV_focus.1.d:0 "The Politiburo of the Soviet Union was meeting once again. This basic aspect of the governance of the Soviet Union had become even more vital than before as of late. Ever since the initial signs of Kamanev's worsening health became more obvious, more and more actions were being handed over to the committee, and talk had grown about how bad their premiers health really was. Lev Kamenv knew that this meeting certainly wouldn't ease those rumors, let alone dispel them. But it was necessary. Kamenev walked slowly to the Central Committee meeting room, his apprehension clear even in his cloudy mind. What if his announcement set in motion events that he knew he could not control? The very thought frightened him deeply, nevertheless, he entered the meeting room. He was greeted by many faces. Among those faces were Kamenv's choices for the leadership of the Union.The faces of Ryutin, Molotov, Ponomaryov, and Khruschev all looked back at him, some with anticipation, others with apprehension. It was true, then, that they wanted to hear the news. Well, Kamenev thought, he would give it to them. "Hello Comrades, today, I have an important announcement...". Kamenev droned on like he always did and increasingly did during his old age. Finally, he arrived at the point. 'Friends, it is the truth that I am old, and that I am not long for the world. Thus, I announce my retirement. I also announce that very soon, I will choose a successor". The men in the room tried their hardest to look shocked, but that was impossible. verias eyes gleaned over the crowd of faces, Khruschev and Molotov talked amongst themselves, while Ryutin and Ponomaryov bickered quietly. Kamenev, seeing that further talk was useless, got up, and left. He feared for the future of the Union."
