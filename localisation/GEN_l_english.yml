 POLITICS_ALBERT_SCHNEZ_DESC:0 "Albert Schnez is, through and through, a devout follower of Hitler’s ideology. By many he is considered a hardliner, and they would be right. Out of the surviving Nazi officials, he is considered one of the most radical members outside of the SS. He served faithfully as a high ranking Wehrmacht officer during the war, until the fall of Germany and Hitler’s death. After the war, no one was really surprised when Schnez and the 25th Panzergrenadier Division followed Albert Speer into Thuringia.\n\nAfter Speer’s death, however, a dispute came about who would succeed him. Between Schnez’s hardliners, Kesselring’s moderate nationalists, and Speidel’s reformists, Schnez has gotten the support of the SS and Radical Wehrmacht divisions. He must do everything he can to defeat the two traitors, reunify Germany, and finally achieve the Thousand Year Reich."
