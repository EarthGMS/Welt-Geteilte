 POLITICS_HANS_SPEIDEL_DESC:0 "You couldn't really say that Hans Spiedel was committed to National Socialism. Spiedel's tenure in the German Army started long before Nazism had been an ideology, and his first on-hand experience with the Nazis were when their Minister of War forced the whole Wehrmacht to take a personal oath of loyalty to Hitler, something Spiedel found more humor than pride in.\n\nBut what started as a regime of humorous theatrics to him became an increasingly irrational beast cannibalizing on itself to exalt the cult of Adolf Hitler. His army career may have made him a conservative, a nationalist and an admirer of fascist resoluteness, but Spiedel could see that the Nazis who promised all three of these things to build a Germany that defended Germans, had merely made a Germany that defended one man only.\n\nDespite his quiet protests, what the Allies would eventually do had destroyed Germany in Spiedel's eyes more than the Nazis ever could. As France swallowed up the Rhineland, every single country would set their eyes on a slice of the German pie. The Russians on Saxony, the British on Hamburg, the Italians on Austria, and the Yugoslavians on Bavaria. This he would not accept.\n\nHe would sooner die than see the legacy of Bismarck be torn apart, but the people surrounding him identified more with the legacy of late Hitler than that of late Bismarck. And if cooperation with the splintered Hitlerites was what it takes for him to preserve a united Germany, then so be it.\n\nBack when he was a soldier, he might have said that there was no blood of oppression on his hands, he could merely deflect such accusations as the occupational hazard of a military man simply being asked to do his job. Those same questions might be harder to answer these days. Even if he tries to justify that the symbol of strength and unity that the Nazis represented was far more important than their rule in practice, the irony still remains that he who had little love for the Nazis was now the one running a Nazi remnant state.\n\nSpiedel might imagine himself as more inspired by the modesty of Salazar than the excesses of Hitler to help himself sleep at night. But under him were the old arms of the state that still imagined themselves enforcers of the late Führer's will. And those sleepless nights were when Spiedel wondered if was it ever the Führer that had crafted the Nazi dictatorship, or was it the Nazi dictatorship that simply required to invent a Führer for itself?"
