 ENG_news.1.t:0 "Death of George VI"
 ENG_news.1.d:0 "Shocking news from Buckingham Palace today as the British Royal Family announces the death of King George VI from coronary thrombosis in the early hours of this morning. The King was a beloved figure to the British populace, leading his people through the Second World War after the abrupt abdication of his elder brother Edward. His heir and daughter Elizabeth is set to be crowned Elizabeth II the next day."

 ENG_flavour.1.t:0 "A Fading Empire"
 ENG_flavour.1.d:0 "The sun never sets on the British Empire.\n\nOr so they say, but in modern times to make this claim requires ignorance about the true situation or pure irony. Despite its victory in the Second World War, the delicate structure that is the British Empire, constructed carefully over countless years, has begun to unravel. The new world order established after the defeat of the Axis in World War II has refused to show kindness towards the colonial empires which Europe has built, calling for their destruction through a process of decolonization.\n\nWhile nations gain their independence left and right, dissatisfaction amongst those who remain in our domain is at its highest yet. While many nationalists call for holding on to the British colonial empire, albeit with a few concessions here and there to adapt it into the modern age, this idea is overly optimistic at best and detrimental to moving the nation forward at worst. Although our great empire has brought civilization to lands across the world, it may be time to let go. While of course this would be a difficult decision, it may ultimately be the only way forward. As the rising giant, the United States, has begun to assert its position in favor of decolonisation, it seems that the sun has finally set on the British Empire."
