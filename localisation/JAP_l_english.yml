 POLITICS_MOSABURO_SUZUKI_DESC:0 "Mosaburō Suzuki’s rise to become Prime Minister of South Japan is undoubtedly unusual. Having graduated from university with a degree in both politics and economics, Suzuki followed a career in politics. Originally working as a reporter on the situation in Siberia during the Japanese intervention, he developed sympathy for the cause of the Bolsheviks. Having visited the Soviet Union several times, he was led towards socialism and then figured that he would bring the revolution that had happened in Russia to his own homeland: Japan. Having joined the Japanese socialist movement, he eventually grew a feeling of contempt for the system Stalin had established in the USSR, one which he decried as a betrayal of the Union’s original revolutionary values.\n\nWhatever the case, Suzuki began engaging himself in Japanese socialist politics, forming conferences, parties, reading groups, and so on as means of agitation to give root to the ideas of socialism in Japan. While many saw his efforts as meaningless, Suzuki remained devoted to the idea that socialist victory would only be brought about by tireless agitation, advocacy, and public activities. Ironically, the Imperial government would soon ban him from public activity during its campaign of political repression against the left in Japan.\n\nAfter the war, Suzuki returned to public life and gained much support within the newly founded Japanese Socialist Party as a radical advocate who delivered arousing speeches to the public. It was only a matter of time before Suzuki had assumed leadership of the party. Now, with his position as Prime Minister of South Japan, Suzuki is prepared to implement his vision for a truly free and prosperous Japan - even if it requires cracking a few eggs."
