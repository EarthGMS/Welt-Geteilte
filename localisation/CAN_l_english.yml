 CAN_legacy_of_mackenzie_king_desc:0 "Mackenzie King led the Canadian nation through its darkest days. He led us through the chaos of the Second World War. He was ardent about his support for Canadian independence, but always remained pragmatic instead of giving in to the populism that had engulfed other nations - he maintained ties to the British homeland and fiercely defended our Commonwealth allies, while simultaneously fostering the actual possibility for an independent Canada. In the end, even the critics of Mackenzie King recognize his brilliance, and there is indeed a reason why he is the longest serving Prime Minister in our great nation’s history. The legacy of Mackenzie King, that which brought us to this day, must not and shall not be forgotten! We must follow his example in this new cold war age of sorts."
