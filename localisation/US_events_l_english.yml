 daily_summary.1.t:0 "DAILY SUMMARY: Turkish Straits Crisis"
 daily_summary.1.d:0 "President Truman was a man with a great many responsibilities and duties. And with great responsibility comes little sleep. He was lucky to squeeze in a few hours of sleep, between managing his campaign for re-election, and of course his present duties as incumbent President of the United States. But he did not allow this to affect him.\n\nToday he woke up at 7:30, like usual, and downed a shot of bourbon whiskey before drinking a large glass of orange juice. This was on the advice of his doctor, of course, as his health was of the utmost necessity not just for him but for the nation he so loved. At 8:00 he had his breakfast, and after a brief staff meeting at 9:00, he settled down for the bulk of his work. This of course included the “daily summary”, in which he was briefed on intelligence and international events and affairs.\n\nThe subject of the daily summary today was the ongoing Turkish Straits crisis, in which the Soviet Union had made a list of great demands towards Turkey that would effectively provide them with control over the straits that connected the Mediterranean and the Black Sea. The Soviet aggression was not only a threat to the national sovereignty of Turkey, but it was also another important frontier of the American-Soviet struggle. He was informed that the present situation required attention and putting down the Soviet aggression could not only lead to a great loss of prestige for the Reds, but could also bring Turkey to adopt closer ties with the United States and join NATO. If only we can find a way to force the hand of the Soviets so they would stand down..."

 daily_summary.2.t:0 "DAILY SUMMARY: The Situation in Korea"
 daily_summary.2.d:0 "With a large glass of orange juice beside him, President Truman settled down in his office to review the daily summary he had been provided earlier that morning. The subject of today’s daily summary was the situation in Korea, something which politicians and generals alike had been barking at each other about for four years without any conclusion.\n\nAs the report detailed, Korea had been occupied by Japan since 1910, and during the Second World War, Japan exploited the Korean people for its own purposes and worked the region to the bone to feed its always-hungry war machine. The north was used primarily for industrial purposes, while the south was used for agricultural purposes. Thus, the north was disproportionately more industrialized than the south during the original division between the United States and the Soviet Union after the war. However, the efforts of American aid programs have managed to significantly develop the south.\n\nThe DPR Korea was granted an observer status on COMECON in 1950, and Soviet aid programs to the North Korean government have rapidly increased since then. This represents a change from the early days after the war, wherein the Soviet government extracted heavy reparations. Now, the two nations are roughly equal in terms of development, with North Korea having the advantage of old, Japanese-era industry and South Korea having the advantage of large American investments into the country.\n\nGeopolitically speaking, it is a shock that the tensions in the area have not already broken out into war. Partisan activities sponsored by the Workers’ Party of Korea have increased exponentially since the merger of the South Korean and North Korean communist parties into one, and the occasional dispute over defectors often leads to skirmishes.\n\nTruman took a large gulp of his glass of orange juice and sighed. The situation seemed to be leading to the inevitable path of deadlock, and Truman knew what the effects of that would be, not only on his personal political career, but on America as a whole."

 daily_summary.3.t:0 "DAILY SUMMARY: The Health of Stalin"
 daily_summary.3.d:0 "As President Truman sat down in his office to read the daily summary, his hands were shaking. He had been, for days now, watching his campaign hopes melting in front of his eyes. Public support was low, especially due to the lack of resolution to the Turkish Straits Crisis which had been ongoing for two years now. Additionally, the corporations’ smear campaign against him had intensified recently since his Fair Deal was introduced, and his popularity was the lowest since the crisis began.\n\nSomething that he had overlooked while on the campaign trail was his health, and ironically the daily summary today was a report on the health of his Soviet counterpart, Joseph Stalin. It was no secret to the Soviet citizens, and the world, that Stalin’s health was in decline. There were even rumors that he had experienced a heart attack recently.\n\nWhatever the case, the decline in Stalin’s health meant that it was certain he would either die or be unfit for office soon enough. When that happened, a power struggle would inevitably break out in the USSR. We know little information about what is already going on within the Soviet bureaucracy, but some of the potential contenders reported by the CIA are Lavrentiy Beria, who instituted Stalin’s great purges and reign of terror, Georgy Malenkov, widely seen as the most likely contender to succeed Stalin, and Nikita Khrushchev, an unlikely contender whose influence has been curbed in recent years by Stalin’s hardliner group. Some also identify Georgy Zhukov as a potential contender, given his massive popularity in the Soviet Union, but others judge that Zhukov is adamantly against acquiring power for himself and views his calling as one in the military.\n\nThe power struggle in the Soviet Union will give the United States an advantage in the Cold War, but it can be expected that this will revert to normal once the power struggle is won, unless we are able to make significant gains during the time of the struggle. It remains to be seen how long Stalin will hold on, and if he will be able to hold on long enough for a Soviet victory in the Turkish Straits Crisis.\n\nWith all this in mind, Truman reached for the orange juice. While pulling it back towards him to drink, he dropped it. The report was drenched in liquid, glass was shattered everywhere, and the orange juice itself had spilled around the office table. Truman sighed."

 USA_flavour.1.t:0 "The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952"
 USA_flavour.1.d:0 "The immigration debate in the United States enters a stage of great concern throughout the American population of communist sympathizers and enemies of our nation infiltrating the routines of daily life, from the State Department to your local coffee shop. Thus, many members of the socalled “restrictionist” faction call for increased regulations on immigration in order to prevent Soviet spies and sympathizers from entering our country. \n\nSenator Pat McCarran took the floor first. “Unrestricted immigration will do nothing but help the Soviet spies and sympathizers in entering into the public scene in America, aiding them in spreading their disgusting philosophy in our nation! This is not something that we can stand for. I will be casting my vote in favor of the Immigration and Nationality Act, for the sake of safeguarding our nation from the Jews and the Communists!” \n\nMcCarran’s radical speech received little applause, even from those who supported him. The man was known for being a raging antisemite and anticommunist, and clashing with the government over the New Deal during the Roosevelt days. With a reputation like this, he could muster little support in the Senate. \n\nNext to speak was Senator Herbert H. Lehman, an opponent of the bill. Unlike McCarran’s, his speech opted for details rather than sensation, elegancy rather than dramatization. He argued that America needed to truly prove itself to be a free and great nation, and that meant promoting immigration in the country. He also pushed from a pragmatic standpoint that public support was in favor of the immigration advocates’ cause. Lehman’s speech did little to impact the vote, however, as it seemed McCarran’s position in the Senate Judiciary Committee had garnered him enough support for the bill to pass. Now, it landed on Truman’s desk - what ought he do with it?"

 USA_flavour.2.t:0 "An Enclave of Black Wealth"
 USA_flavour.2.d:0 "Despite how it has treated his people, Francois believed in America. He had struggled for decades running a plumbing business in Alabama, something he wouldn’t let you know in a rush due to him being the only black person in the company, since rich white Alabamians wouldn’t really let black people in the house to fix their pipes. But as the 1950s rolled on and segregation was loosened, his business soared into a mini-empire of sorts, an enclave of black wealth in the midst of destitution. Francois believed that being a black family prosperous enough to be in a white neighborhood could shield them from the racism that impoverished black people had long endured. Wealth supersedes skin color, or at least he believed so.\n\nBut not today, for the family’s tranquil Saturday afternoon was disrupted by a violent knock on their door, and protesters breaching inside their fence. They were the segregationists in Montgomery County whose rallies had broken down into riots. Francois looked outside to see they were already trashing his plot, and some of their faces he recognized. Some of his neighbors, that thought Francois had a house too nice for his skin color, his employees too embarrassed to mentioning that their boss was black, and his business rivals that berated Francois for getting his negro hands on white men’s business opportunities.\n\nFrancois wanted to call the cops before he realized that members of the local police were already outside his house, in tandem with the rioters. His family had nowhere to go, and as soon as the rioters broke down his door and marched inside his house, Francois realized that he hadn’t shielded his family from anything after all."

 USA_flavour.3.t:0 "Bread and Roses"
 USA_flavour.3.d:0 "John Kennedy turned on his television. Questions were flying everywhere after the Montgomery riots. All of a sudden, civil rights had re-entered the political landscape, and it was the decision of President Truman how to respond. Kennedy had faith in Truman to make the right decision; America needed to be a nation where all men were equals, and therefore civil rights was imperative. Truman had already desegregated the military - prompting quite the reaction from the Dixiecrats - and had been willing to risk the Democrats' election chances through this decision, which led to defections to Thurmond's party.\n\nWhile representing Massachusetts in the Senate, Kennedy had experienced the disgusting racism of his Dixiecrat colleagues, Strom Thurmond and his protégé from Alabama, George Wallace. And he was determined to put an end to it. Now four years since the Dixiecrats' walkout, little had changed. Now was the time for initiative. But Kennedy's heart sank as he listened to Truman's speech.\n\n"We must condemn thoroughly the violence that occurred in Montgomery. I can ensure all Americans that our administration is, and will remain, dedicated to retaining law and order in all fifty states. I believe that we must firmly call for a cooling-off period between both sides in the events in Alabama. We must maintain peace and order, and that means we must put out the fires of political violence wherever they spring up."\n\nThe young Senator could not believe what he was hearing. A cooling-off period? Truman's political pragmatism seemed to be quickly turning into a surrender to Thurmond and the Dixiecrats. Perhaps Henry Wallace and his allies were right about Truman? Kennedy turned the television off. He knew what he had to do."

 USA_flavour.4.t:0 "The Defection"
 USA_flavour.4.d:0 "4:00 AM. Washington, D.C.\n\nSenator John Fitzgerald Kennedy waited impatiently in front of the D.C. headquarters of the Progressive Party. Henry Wallace had agreed to hold a meeting with him, and he had arrived an hour early. So now he stood completely frozen in front of the building, the anticipation within him slowly building up. He checked his watch every now and then. 45 minutes. 30 minutes. 25 minutes. 20 minutes. 10 minutes. 5 minutes. And-\n\nAfter what felt like an eternity, the watch reached 5:00. Kennedy entered the building and was quickly greeted by one of Wallace's staffers. He walked into the room, where Wallace was waiting. "Make yourself at home," he uttered, and Kennedy sat down. Although Wallace opened his mouth to speak, it was Kennedy that spoke first, spilling out the words he had waited all these painful hours to say.\n\n"Mr. Wallace, I would like to join the Progressive Party.""
