 fading_imperialism_desc:0 "A hundred years ago, we ventured across the world in a great adventure to explore the darkest corners of the world, from the little islands of Polynesia to the infinite sands and jungles of Africa, and in those pieces of the world we brought civilization where there was none, and with our strength and determination we built a continents-spanning empire to last for all eternity, but with our “victory” in WW2 before, and our defeat in Indochina then, all of this risks to be no more. Our glorious empire is crumbling at the seams, less and less people are willing to maintain it and more natives are becoming bolder and hostile towards us. If we do not do something fast about our colonies, the natives will, but if we ever choose to do something, it’s up to us whether to avoid bloodshed or fight for our territories like we did in the 40s."
 wartime_destruction:0 "Wartime Destruction"
 wartime_destruction_desc:0 "During the war, France was devastated by its brutal occupation by the Nazis. When finally the German war machine gave way and a united front of French partisans, American and British soldiers, and resistance fighters were able to liberate France and wave the tricolor over Paris once again. Despite the victory in the war and the sounding of trumpets and church bells across France, the nation had faced destruction on a level it had never seen before. The French people are persistent, and have faced these problems head-on, but it will not be easy to rebuild the nation."
 divided_politics:0 "Divided Politics"
 divided_politics_desc:0 "The French nation is a nation divided. While the government holds, two extremes tug on the rope that is the Parliament. On one hand, the communists, known for heavy involvement in the partisan activity and their role in the liberation of France from Nazi forces in the end of the Second World War. On the other hand, the Gaulleists led by the enigmatic Charles de Gaulle and the “remnant” of France’s past, Paul Reynaud. While the communists remain preoccupied with disputes in the party after the expulsion of Maurice Thorez and the power struggle between the hardliners of Jacques Duclos and the reformists of Waldeck Rochet and André Marty, the struggle continues on without end."
