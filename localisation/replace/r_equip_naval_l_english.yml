 GER_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "D Class"
 GER_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The D-class were a pair of cruisers. The ships were improved versions of the preceding Deutschland-class cruisers. They were intended to counter a new French naval construction program. Displacement increased to 20,000 t, but Hitler allowed only increases to armor, prohibiting additions to the ships' main battery. Only one of the two ships was laid down, but it was canceled less than five months after the keel was laid. It was determined that the designs should be enlarged to counter the new French Dunkerque-class ships. The construction contracts for both ships were superseded by the Scharnhorst-class battleships."
 GER_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "P Class"
 GER_battleship_1:0 "Bayern Class"
 GER_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Bayern class was a class of four super-dreadnought battleships built by the German Kaiserliche Marine during WWI. The class comprised Bayern, Baden, Sachsen, and Württemberg. Only Baden and Bayern were completed, due to shipbuilding priorities changing as the war dragged on. It was determined that U-boats were more valuable to the war effort, and so work on new battleships was slowed and ultimately stopped altogether. As a result, Bayern and Baden were the last battleships completed by the Kaiserliche Marine during WWI."
 GER_carrier_2:0 "Jade Class"
 GER_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Jade class comprised a pair of passenger ships intended to be converted into auxiliary aircraft carriers. The two ships were launched as Gneisenau and Potsdam in 1935. After the outbreak of war, the ships were requisitioned by the Kriegsmarine as transports, and in May 1942, plans were drawn up to convert them into aircraft carriers. The ships were not identical, but were similar enough in size to allow identical outfitting."
 GER_submarine_1:0 "Type IIA"
 GER_submarine_1_desc:0 "The German Type IIA submarine was a single hull, all welded coastal submarine with internal ballast tanks. It displaced over 250 tons and mounts five 533mm torpedo tubes. Six were built between 1934 and 1935." 
 GER_submarine_2:0 "Type VII"
 GER_submarine_2_desc:0 "Type VII submarines were the most widely used U-boats of the war and were the most produced submarine class in history, with 703 built. The type had several modifications. "
 GER_submarine_3:0 "Type XB"
 GER_submarine_3_desc:0 "The Type XB class was intended as long-range mine-layers. They only had two torpedo tubes at the stern and could carry up to 66 SMA mines in 30 mine shafts and up to 15 torpedoes. They were later used as long-range cargo transports."

 #USSR
 SOV_destroyer_3:0 "Project 35"
 SOV_destroyer_3_desc:0 "Project 35 is a “large” destroyer with universal artillery, designed in 1939–1941 for the Soviet Navy as a part of the “Ten-Year Plan for the Construction of Navy Ships” (1938–1947). This destroyer project was developed under the influence of the newest foreign ships of this class in order to achieve better seaworthiness, range and survivability in comparison with the destroyers of the projects 7 and 7-U."
 SOV_destroyer_4:0 "Project 40"
 SOV_destroyer_4_desc:0 "Project 40 is a destroyer with universal artillery of the main caliber, placed in three turrets, which was designed in 1942-1945 for the Soviet Navy. This project was created taking into account the experience of the Second World War, and in comparison with previous projects of destroyers (projects 30 and 35) should have improved seaworthiness and new equipment and weapons. The technical task of the Project 40 demanded creation of a "big destroyer for ocean service" to use it on Pacific and Arctic theaters of war."
 SOV_light_cruiser_2:0 "Project 28"
 SOV_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "This is a light cruiser which was the development of the ships of the Kirov Class cruisers (Project 26). From the prototype, the cruiser was distinguished by its large size, significantly enhanced protection and rapid-fire artillery of smaller caliber. Design development was cancelled after introduction of technical task for the new type light cruiser (Project 68). "
 SOV_battleship_3:0 "Project UP.41"
 SOV_battleship_3_desc:0 "UP.41 was a project made by Ansaldo for the Soviet Union(which eventually chose to go for Project 23 as their new battleship). The primary and secondary artillery would have a disposition with 9 406/50 mm cannons and 12 152/55 mm, very similar to the Littorio class. "
 SOV_SH_battleship_2:0 "Project 24"
 SOV_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "Project 24 is a successor of the Project 23. The new battleship was designed with information of the Montana-class that were planned for construction in the USA. Weighed 72,950 in tonnage, it is armed with 9 406 mm main guns and 16 130 mm dual-purpose secondary guns. With the death of Stalin, the project was canceled. "
 SOV_carrier_2:0 "Project 69AV"
 SOV_carrier_2_desc:0 "Project 69AV was a carrier design based on the Kronstadt-class(Project 69) battlecruiser hull. It measured 240 meters length in waterline with 32,000 tons standard. 76 aircrafts were intended and armament consisted 8 dual 130mm guns and 16 dual 37mm AA guns. "
 
 #USA
 USA_battleship_4:0 "Illinois Class"
 USA_battleship_4_desc:0 "This is a hypothetical battleship. The Illinois Class continued with the design and role defined by the Iowa Class. It maintained speed and armament over armor. The Illinois Class increased the number of 16"/50 caliber guns from 9 to 12 while it also improved boilers and machinery in order to provide more efficient high cruise speeds. Like the Montana Class, initial designs included four 4 6" guns dual turrets, but this was reverted to the dual purpose 5" twin turret emplacements to maximize AA capabilities."
 USA_SH_battleship_1:0 "Montana Class"
 USA_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Montana Class was bigger and more armored than the Iowa Class, sacrificing speed to accommodate the increase. Its main armament of 12 x 18"/50 caliber guns and with the latest fire control system the Montana's firepower will be unmatched. Initial designs included 6" guns, but this was changed to return to the dual purpose 5" twin turret emplacements."
 USA_SH_battleship_2:0 "Design BB-65-8"
 USA_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "This is a semi-hypothetical super-heavy battleship. BB-65-8 is originally an early blue print of Montana Class, with top-tier performence in design. Weighed 67,000 in tonnage, it has a reletively higher speed, 12 main guns and heavy protection. However its enormous size got it cancelled along with the cancellation of new navigation locks in the Panama Canal. Now with the war escalated, this blue print has came to the attention of US Navy once again."

 ENG_light_cruiser_4:0 "Neptune Class"
 ENG_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Neptune class was a proposed class of cruisers planned for the British Royal Navy in the latter years of the Second World War. They were large ships which were to be armed with twelve 6-inch main guns and with twelve 4.5-inch dual purpose guns. While five ships of the class were planned in 1944, they were cancelled following the end of the war, before construction could begin."
 ENG_submarine_3:0 "V Class"
 ENG_submarine_3_desc:0 "The V-class or Vampire-class submarines were based on the previous U-class smaller sized boats. They were larger but still relatively small, with better seagoing ability but limited operational range and weaponry." 
 ENG_submarine_4:0 "A Class"
 ENG_submarine_4_desc:0 "The A or Amphion class of British diesel-electric submarines were designed for use in the Pacific War. Only two were completed before the end of hostilities.
